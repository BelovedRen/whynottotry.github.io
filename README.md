		 <div class ='block1' align = 'center'> <p> When you open your eyes and find yourself in jeans and a sweatshirt in the depths of the forest, with tangled hair and rays of moonlight on the face and wrists, suspiciously like fetters, with a bitten lip and a terrible headache, you want to close your eyes back and wake up safely....  </div></p>
                    <div class ='block1' align = 'center'> <p>   It is necessary to drive back the panic approaching the throat, trying to break out with a wild cry, take a deep breath and take a few steps forward, carefully, almost falling. How cold it is ... I looked around. Only forest and two moons hung in the sky, huge, with a purple tint, they seemed so unrealistic that I involuntarily stood on tiptoe and extended my hand, trying to touch one of them, confident that both the moons and the forest were parting from mine touch, like a shaky obsession.

There was no concussion, and the world before my eyes finally focused in a clear picture, which could not but rejoice. Between the trunks of the trees I could make out a faint light. I really hope that this is not the light at the end of the tunnel, but I didn’t have much choice, if you think about it. Although, you can always just sit on the ground, leaning your back against one of the trunks of tall trees and hope for good luck ... Anyway, there is a risk of freezing to death, but suddenly you're lucky?  </div> </p>
